![Manufacturing Dashboard](P10_Manufacturing_dashboard.png)

#### **Description**
This repository contains an interactive dashboard built using Excel to analyze records of manufacturing production processes. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as production efficiency, inventory turnover, product quality, and time to market, along with details about production lines and suppliers.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains records with the following columns:

- Date: The date of the recorded data point.
- Production Line: The specific production line where the data was recorded.
- Supplier: The supplier associated with the production process.
- Production Efficiency: The efficiency of the production process (as a percentage).
- Inventory Turnover: The rate at which inventory is used and replaced.
- Product Quality: The quality score of the products produced (on a scale of 1 to 10).
- Time to Market: The time taken to bring the product from concept to market (in days).

#### **Features**

The Excel dashboard includes the following features:

- Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data based on Date, Production Line, and Supplier.

- KPI Visualizations: Displays key metrics such as Production Efficiency, Inventory Turnover, Product Quality, and Time to Market.

- Trend Analysis: Provides trend lines and charts to analyze performance over time.

- Production Line Insights: Charts to visualize performance across different production lines and compare efficiency and quality metrics.

- Supplier Analysis: Insights into supplier performance and its impact on production processes.

- Customizable Views: Users can customize the dashboard views to focus on specific metrics, production lines, or suppliers of interest.

#### **Technologies Used**

- **Excel Pivot**: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations (choose as per your tool).
